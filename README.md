# React App to generate images using StyleGAN

This project demonstrates my ability to deploy a StyleGAN pre-trained model as an API endpoint, which is then integrated into a React app. It is a re-attempt of the [PGGAN project](https://github.com/VincentLu91/PGGAN_IG_data_app) that uses a different GAN model used in a web application.

Keys, tokens, and API endpoints are removed from the codebase to prevent from being exposed. Also the endpoints rely on rented cloud GPU to be called and I turned them off to avoid overspending.
